- 'git clone <URL>': downloads the repository from the web to our computer
	- just like 'git init', you can type it once per folder
	- don't nest this command


## Branches

- 'git branch' will create a new branch
- git switch branch name>: move to a new branch
- 'git checkout <branch_name>: old way of moving to branch
- 'git switch -c <branch_name>

- 'git fetch prune' to synch with repo
- 'git branch -d <branch name> - delete branch
